# Word-networks 📚🔍

Explore the fascinating world of word networks through this practical work, which delves into the comparison between graphs constructed from interactions between words. 

## Overview 🌟
This practical work examines the relationships between words derived from two distinct sources: 

1. **Free Associations Experiment**: Discover the intricate web of relationships between words based on a free associations experiment.
2. **Semantic Distances Calculation**: Explore the semantic distances between words calculated using word2vec embedding.

## Key Highlights 🎉
- **Graph Construction**: Graphs corresponding to both sets of interactions are constructed and plotted.
- **Characterization**: Detailed characterization of the graphs is performed, including analysis of:
  - Number of edges
  - Centrality measures
  - Network diameter
  - Connections between elements
  - Community detection

## Comparative Analysis 🔄
Through meticulous comparisons, gain insights into the similarities and differences between the two types of word interactions.

## Prototype Networks 🚀
Experience the construction of prototype networks using the set of words derived from the experimentation, offering a glimpse into the underlying structures and patterns.
